Android To-Do List Application

Project Overview

My Project is a simple Android to-do list application. The app allows users to:

- Add new tasks

- Display tasks in a ListView

- Mark tasks complete/incomplete using a CheckBox

- Delete tasks via long-press

- Persist data locally using SQLite

The project demonstrates core Android development concepts including UI layout, event-driven programming, custom adapters, and persistent storage. It follows an iterative weekly update structure and includes a version changelog to show progress.
